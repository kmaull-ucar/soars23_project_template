# Manuscript

You can write your manuscript in a variety of tools, but one way to keep all of your things in one place, is to place a PDF (or a text version of the document) in Github.

This will allow for a more complete presentation of your research.

You may also consider writing your manuscript in LaTeX or Markdown, both of which are easy to manage in Github, and are also easy to convert to various formats once done.
